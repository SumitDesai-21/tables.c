# tables.c
A C-based student grade analysis system that processes CSV data to calculate grades, CGPA, identify toppers, and detect failed subjects. Built with custom functions for modularity and efficiency, focusing on logic-building without built-in string functions like strtok.

# Student Grade Analysis System 📊  

## Description  
This project is a **C-based grade analysis system** designed to process student data efficiently. It reads and processes data from three CSV files—`subjects.csv`, `grades.csv`, and `marks.csv`—to **calculate grades, CGPA, identify toppers, and analyze student performance**. The focus is on **building logic from scratch** without using built-in string functions like `strtok`, ensuring modularity and hands-on learning.

## Features  
✔️ Calculate student grades and CGPA.  
✔️ Identify subject toppers and semester toppers.  
✔️ Detect failed subjects for each student.  
✔️ Modular design with custom functions for efficiency.
