## Student Grade Analysis System

A **C-based grade analysis system** that processes student data from CSV files to calculate grades, compute CGPA, identify toppers, and detect failed subjects.
This project emphasizes **core logic-building skills** by avoiding built-in string functions like `strtok`, instead using **custom parsing methods** for enhanced modularity and learning.

### Project Overview

This program simulates a **student grade analysis system** that:

* Reads data from three CSV files:

  * `subjects.csv` — Subject details
  * `grades.csv` — Grade mappings
  * `marks.csv` — Students' marks
* Processes the data to:

  * Calculate individual grades and overall CGPA.
  * Identify subject toppers and semester toppers.
  * Detect subjects where students have failed.

It’s designed for **Students and Programmers** looking to strengthen their C programming skills through **file handling**, **data processing**, and **modular design**.

### Features

* **Grade Calculation:** Computes grades and CGPA for every student.
* **Topper Identification:** Detects both subject-wise and semester-wise toppers.
* **Failure Detection:** Lists failed subjects for each student.
* **Modular Structure:** Built with **custom functions** for clean, maintainable code.
* **Pure C Logic:** No use of functions like `strtok`—all string parsing is done manually for deep learning.

### CSV File Descriptions

#### `subjects.csv`

| Subject Name       | Credits      | Semester     |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| PSPP               | 3            | 1            |
| CL                 | 1            | 1            |

#### `grades.csv`

| Min Marks | Max Marks | Grade | Grade Point |
| --------- | --------- | ----- | ----------- |
| 77        | 88        | AA    | 10          |
| 60        | 77        | AB    | 9           |

#### `marks.csv`

|  MIS NO.  | PSPP      | CL    | PPL   |  DSA   | OS    |  CN   |  TOC  |
|  -------  | --------- | ----- | ----- |------- | ------| ----- | ----- |
| 612303001 | 82        | 85    | 90    | 67     | 68    |  85   |  90   |

### How to Run

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SumitDesai-21/grade_analysis_system.git
cd grade_analysis_system
```

#### 2. Compile the Program

Use `gcc` to compile the project:

```bash
gcc tables.c -o t
```

#### 3. Run the Program

```bash
./t
```

#### Prerequisites:

* GCC compiler installed (`sudo apt install gcc` on Linux Terminal).
* All CSV files (`subjects.csv`, `grades.csv`, `marks.csv`) must be in the **same directory** as `tables.c`.

### Key Concepts Used

* File I/O in C (`fopen`, `fgets`, etc.)
* Manual string parsing
* Data structures (arrays - 1D and 2D, structs)
* Custom functions for modularity and reusability
* Error handling for file operations

### Learning Objectives

* Master **file operations** and **data parsing** in C.
* Enhance **problem-solving** by writing manual string parsers.
* Understand how to design modular, scalable C projects.
